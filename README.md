# The Commodore Designs
The default Gatsby starter.

## Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:
```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd gatsby-example-site
gatsby develop
```

Or you can build it by:
```sh
gatsby build
```

## Deploy

I deployed this site using firebase:
```sh
firebase deploy
```
